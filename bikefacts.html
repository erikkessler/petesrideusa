<h3>Hey Peter, </h3>
<b>How long did it take you do it?</b>

<br />
It took me 71 days to complete my trip to Yorktown and put my tire in the James River.
I was gone in total 91 days.  The last 20 or so days I spent goofing around.  I got a job, 
sat out a couple of hurricanes and nearly eaten alive by ants. 
<br /><br />
<b> How many flat tires did you get?</b>
<br />
My guess is about 20.  Most of those however were do to rim problems.  
In about a 1 week span I had about 15 flats. 
<br />
<br />
<b>How many states were you in?</b>
<br />
13 States.  Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, 
Kentucky, Virgina, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
<br />
<br />
<b>What were your favoite states?</b> 
 Montana and Idaho for their vastness and beauty, North Carolina for its beaches on the Outer
 Banks and Virgina for its History.   Wait........They were all my favorites for a variety of 
reasons.
<br />
<br />
<b>How much did it cost?</b>
<br/>
About $4000.00. Not bad for 3 months of sightseeing and good nights sleep. 
<br><br>
<b>Why did you choose then to do it?</b>
<br>
It was time to leave the job I had for nearly 5 years.  I owed nothing on my credit cards 
and wanted a fun way to go back into debt.<br>
<br />
<b>Where did you start and finish your trip?</b>
<br />I started in Florence Oregon and finished in Charleston South Carolina.<br><br>
<b>Where you ever scared?
</b>
<br />
Only once in Montana. I was the only one camping in a primative campground and 1970ish sedan 
drove in and out of the site.  It felt as though he was staking out the area to make a whatever.  I slept that night 
with my knife open and in easy reach for quick use. <br><br>
<b>Why did you choose that route?</b>
<br />
I started on the Bicentenial Route, established in 1976.  After Missula Montana 
I went off the route and headed to Devils Tower and Mount Rushmore.  Then headed to the 
Mississippi to Hannible Missouri.  I caught the Bicentenial Routed in Illinois.  Yorktown 
to  Charleston was just for fun.  See the beaches, some alligators, and live through a 
few hurricanes. 
<br/><br>
<b>How much weight did you loose?</b>
<br />I was down to 144 lbs, 11 lbs..  A lean mean machine.  Gained it back in about 4 months.
<br /><br />
<b>What did you eat?</b>
<br />
Lots of fried food, fruit any time I could and Poptarts each and every morning 
(cinnamon whenever possible)
<br /><br /><br />
<b> What was the hardest part?</b>
<br />
Phyically, the beginning going over the Cascades and Rockies.  I was not in great shape at that point and to 
start the Cascades on the 4th day was killer.  The real hardest part.  Deciding to do it.  After 
that.....all was easy.
<br /><br />
<b>What was the best part?</b>
<br />
Besides the people I met along the way, the best part was that I could feel the pulse of life/nature/the elements for three months.

<br />
