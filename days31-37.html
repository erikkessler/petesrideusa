<h1 align=center><b> Bike Ride USA Journal</b>
</h1><b>DAY 31</b>  Scenic to White River 101 miles. Took Hwy 44. Yes, I did the Bad Lands in a day and I have no pictures to prove it. I was out on the road before 7:00 and the locals were at the bar before I left. I was glad to get out of that place. I passed many reservation run towns and am very glad to get out of there. The people are always kind and helpful but the stores are dirty and the homes are worse. The roads out here are lined with more empty Bud Lite cans than all of the all the Bay Areas Safeways put together. I ended up showering at a motel for 5 bucks and camped out on the grass behind it. An Indian offered me the use of the town park but I wanted to check out all my options. Gee, I wonder why? I ended up drinking and talking to a few hunters staying at the motel. They were comparing guns, scopes, triggers, etc. with the guns out in plain public view. Try having that "show and tell" conversation in California. The guys were all in their 40s and 50s and were prairie dog hunting for the farmers. Hired Guns. The motel owner had a black lab with 3-week-old pups in the back yard. The lab however, spend the night in front of my tent, I think protecting me. What was incredible was for the first time in years I had a hard hit of Snoopy. Though Snoopy died when I was 13, I realized she has been along side me throughout this trip and this black lad was doing as Snoopy had asked it to do. Thanks Snoops. Every night bugs are eating me. <br><br> <b>Day 32</b>  White River to Wood 15 miles. I stopped to have breakfast at a little cafe in Wood. It took me 3 tries to leave. 1) After Lunch I went 1 mile down the road and I broke a spoke. I was 50 miles from a bike shop (Pierre) so I had to have them come deliver and fix it for me. A 25 cent part cost me 42 dollars. I spent 4 hours at a Texaco station waiting for the repair guy. 2) I said my goodbyes to my close friends at the station and left town. About 200 yards away my tire goes flat. Again I had to unpack my bike to fix it. While I was on the side of the road fixing my flat A woman drove by and asked if I needed help and were I was headed. She informed me that a big storm was on its way and that it sounded bad. I ended up having dinner at her place and spent the night in here back yard until he wind and rain pulled my tent stakes out of the ground then I moved into her living room. It only lasted 30 minutes. 3) With my Bike tire fixed the next day, I was again on my way. 200yards later the same tube blew and so did the tire. Easiest bike shop, 50 miles. Lois took me in her truck to Valentine Nebraska. New route and new state. <br><br><table align=right><tr> <td><image src="images/mailbox1.jpg"align=right align=middle></td></tr><tr><td align=center><b>Mailbox:  Middle American Pride</b></td></tr></table> <b>Day 33 </b> Wood to Valentine to Wood Lake. 20 miles by bike 70 miles by bike/car. In Valentine I had my bike and tires looked over by a bike shop. After 2 hours at Yucca Dunes Bike shop (A great/fun bike shop owned and operated by a family and their spouses). I was on my way. 20 miles down the road at Wood Lake, another blow out even with a new tire and new tub. I spent the night at the city park and called Yucca Dunes. They delivered a new tire and repair stuff the next morning. The homes out here are incredibly well maintained.  Even the mailboxes are fun to look at.  The care the people out here take in there homes makes the one feel they did it just for me.  It kinda makes you feel welcome in their lives. 
 <br><br>
<b>Day 34</b>  Wood Lake to ONeil 84 miles Hwy 20. The bike shop delivered my tire and repair stuff. The sister in law drove down in her minivan and 3 year old kid to deliver the the goods. I repaired my bike and was on the road again. It rained almost all the way today so road rash paid me another visit. When I got to town I stopped to ask a couple directions to the Laundromat. That person turned out to be only in down to do a book signing/promotion. What kind of book you ask? A book about his cross country bike ride 4 years ago. I did my laundry and then went to their motel room to talk. (Dick and Maryanne) <a href="http://www.adv-cycling.org/cgi-shl/webc.exe/advsales/st_prod.html?p_prodid=193">Book by 			Dick Swinnerman<a/> I ended up showering in their room and talked to 11:00. Camped out in city park. <br><br> <b>Day 35</b>  O'Neil to Osmand. 57 miles Tom and Phyll gave me $20. (a couple that had their trip cancelled due to bad luck and loved my stories.) I felt like garbage today. The ride was hot and against the wind. I visited the Nebraska Zoo were Johnny Carson donated $55,000 to build a building. I napped and Interneted in Plainview 'til 5:00. I went to the next town, Osmand, and camped in the city park. The girls at the park let me shower at the pool and then several of the local kids calling me Biker Dude asked me to swim with them. Madeline (lifeguard) and Mike were the main characters. Mike (12 years old) showed me town and it only cost me buying him dinner.  Well worth it.   A cute town/park. I would trade RHC for that park any day. <br><br> <b>Day 36 </b> Osmand to Sioux City. 67 miles. Just as I was packing to leave Mrs Boyes was coming back from her 2 mile ride and asked if I wanted breakfast. She brought out homemade bread, eggs sausage and fruit. Best room service I ever had. Hwy. 20 all the way to the Iowa border. The ride stunk. Lots of straight rolling hills up and down all day. Hwy 20 into town had no shoulder and lots of holes. I lost one of my packs after hitting a bump and would have fallen into traffic if it was not to my incredible athletic ability and some, well lots of luck. Camped at Scenic Campground and fixed pack.  <br><br><b>Day 37</b>  Sioux City to Ida Grove 54 miles. Lots of wind and all miles were earned.  Took 20  to 159  to 175. There are no bike shoulders in Iowa. Ida Grove was a neat town with a castle for most everything. Skating Rink, Stores, Hotels etc. Some Millionaire lives in town and likes/donates/builds the places. Camped out at city park and had a burger for dinner. I am getting tired of burgers.
