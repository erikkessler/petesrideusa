<h1 align= "center">And.. I Did This Why....?</h1>



<p>  In college during the early 80's, and few friends and I talked about bicycling across the US.  At the time we ran cross country for Humboldt State University, and were in the best condition of our lives.  
As  summer approached, the talk lessened as jobs, money and girls came into our lives. Needless to say, the trip never materialized.  In the fall the following year, I opened up the Contra Coast Times to find a picture of my friend sitting beside his bike with a long article decribing his adventure 
across the United States. When I saw it, I became a little ticked off, and I don't think I even read 
the article. </p>

<p>Years passed, slowly the indestructable 20 year old body started to show 
its miles. In 1997 I had a psycic reading (paid for and forced volunteered by my employer 
at the time) hinted that my life had hit a stand still and mention that in order to move on, I 
had to embark on the long forgotten adventure that burned deep inside me.  This bycycle trip was that adventure.   I got my credit 
cards down to "0", I was getting really tired of my current job and I started biking more and 
running less due to injury. My ducks were now in order, for a 4500 mile solo bicycle tour across the United States.<br/><br/>
